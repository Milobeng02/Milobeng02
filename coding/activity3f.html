<h1>Introduction of  Parapraph Tag </h1>
<p>
In HTML, paragraphs are defined with the p tag. <br>
A paragraph element in an HTML document is made up of content <br>
such as text, images, or other content <br>
which appears between an opening p tag and closing p tag.<br>
</p>

<p>
p tag is the HTML tag for a paragraph. Adding the p tag to an HTML doc, 
followed by text, will create a paragraph on your page. <br>
Adding the closing p tag will end the paragraph.
